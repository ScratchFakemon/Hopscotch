# Loadables
## Loadables are programs that can be loaded into Hopscotch via the Load command.
### This folder has all the official Loadables that are confirmed to work and are safe.
#### Loadables are similar to extensions in the TurboWarp Extension Gallery.

## How to get Loadables:

```hopscotch
Load test
//It's that simple!
//The source is automatically set to this folder, and ".hlb" (Hopscotch Loadable) is automatically added to the end of the filename.
```

## How to use Loadables:

```hopscotch
hlb: test|hello
//All Loadables have a file extension of .hlb,
//And to use them, start the line of code with "hlb: "
//followed by [The Loadable's Name]|[Data to send to the Loadable]
```

## Loading and using a Loadable in One Program

```hopscotch
Load test
//Loads the "test" Loadable
hlb: test|hello
//Sends the data "hello" to the Loadable "test"
```
